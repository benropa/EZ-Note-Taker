## Usage
The goal for my project is to have a user open the Heroku link to test out the code, but unfortunately I haven't gotten it to deploy correctly. Within VS Code, the user can clone this repository, run "npm i", navigate into the command line, and enter "npm start." Then, the user should go to localhost:3001 in their browser to be able to work with the application. 

### Deployed Application: https://bens-ez-note-taker.herokuapp.com/

## Video
I have included a video demonstration as I could not get my application to deploy in Heroku.

Nevermind, I got it to work.
